# Learning NEXT.js

## Important information 

### React vs NEXT 

* Next is not REACT or a React replacement. More of an extention.

* NEXT is a React Framework for pre-rendered React websites. 

* React without NEXT react renders components in browser(client side rendering.) 

* SSR (Server Side Rendering) 

* SSR and SSG both improve website performance (Less work has to be done in the browser) and also enhance SEO

### Creating a NEXT app

```npx create-next-app@latest [app name]```
