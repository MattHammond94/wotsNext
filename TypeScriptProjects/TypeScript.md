# Learning TypeScript

### Why TypeScript? And wot even is it dude?

* Built on top of JavaScript to give extra features (Known as a superset of JavaScript)

* Primary feature is to add TYPES to values

* If we define a variable as a specfic TYPE i.e. String. It can only ever be a string.

### Benefits:

* Strongly typed languages give better error feedback. 

* Type checking means more bug location before run time. 

### Installing TypeScript:

* TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript so it can run in a appropriate environment (Like Node)

```npm install -g typescript```

> This installs TypeScript globally. Typescript can be installed as a dependency in individual projects if this is preferred. 

```tsc [filename]```

compiles selected file and produces a JS copy that can be run.
